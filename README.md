ScamCheck can analyze text copied directly from social media platforms, dating applications, and private messaging services to detect early indicators of romance scams and financial fraud. Users can paste conversations from dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Match, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish (POF), eHarmony, Zoosk, Coffee Meets Bagel, and Facebook Dating, as well as social and messaging platforms including Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), TikTok, WhatsApp, Telegram, Snapchat, Discord, LinkedIn, SMS, and email. The system evaluates emotional manipulation, rapid relationship escalation, secrecy requests, urgency framing, investment narratives, cryptocurrency pitches, wire transfer or gift card requests, and grooming behaviors, providing an early-warning risk assessment before financial or emotional harm occurs.

text
"My God. We've only been talking for 72 hours and I feel like I've known you for years. This isn't normal. This connection... it's immediate and deep. You're my everything. My heart beats faster every time your message pops up. I was lying in bed last night, dreaming of you, dreaming of our future together. I want to build a life with you, a life without money stress. A dream house. Marriage. Everything. And I can make that happen. Today alone, I made $18,000 on a digital asset arbitrage play on my platform. The system has a guaranteed return—it's not luck, it's algorithmic precision with smart contract logic. I want to guide you personally through this. I can open a VIP account for you on my exchange. We'll start with a small test deposit—just $3,000 USDT to see how the compound cycle works. It's a secure, encrypted wallet. This is our first step toward financial sovereignty together. Say yes, and I'll book flights to finally meet you next month. I'm already yours, completely."
